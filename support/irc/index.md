If the documentation isn't enough and you need in-person help, you can try the
`#wxwidgets` channel on the [Libera][1] IRC server (`irc.libera.chat`). This
channel is regularly filled with many people who are all very experienced with
wxWidgets and are often willing to help.

## Tips for Getting Help

The wxWidgets IRC channel is an active and growing community of wxWidgets users
who will gladly share their knowledge to help you get your wxWidgets code
working. However, they are also generally busy people, so there are some things
you can do to improve your chances of getting a helpful answer to your
questions.

### Don't Ask to Ask

**Avoid** questions like this:

* Is anyone here?
* Does anyone know anything about ______?
* Has anyone ever done ______?
* Are any of the wxWidgets developers here?

Most people simply ignore these questions. They have found that answering them
causes the recipient to expect personal attention from them, and they don't
want to set that expectation without knowing the scope of the problem. Just
asking what you want to know will be far more effective.

The last question also presumes that the rest of the users aren't good enough
to help you with your problem. You may be surprised to learn how much regular
users know about the framework's internals.

### Provide Enough Information to Solve the Problem

* If you're getting an error, copy and paste the real error. Don't paraphrase,
  don't retype, don't interpret. Error messages contain details that you might
  miss but that are probably essential.
* Provide just enough code that will compile and will demonstrate the problem.
  Occasionally incomplete code can be useful, but in most cases the person
  helping you will need to run the code. That person probably does not have
  time to work to try to compile it.
* Tell people what you expect to happen and what is actually happening. If you
  only include one or the other, no one will be able to figure out what you
  want help with.
* Don't flood IRC channels. If you have more than a very few lines to paste,
  use a [pastebin].

### Be Patient

* Stick around the channel for a while after asking. Many people check their
  IRC windows regularly but infrequently.
* Don't complain about how quiet or unhelpful the channel is. That's a sure way
  to turn away people who might have been thinking about helping.

### Be Courteous

* Check the [manual], the [FAQ], and the [wiki] first. People hate answering
  RTFM questions.
* Don't privately message people without permission. Unsolicited private
  messages are considered intrusive and annoying. (Besides, when you get your
  support in public, others may learn from it, too.)
* Don't complain about how much wxWidgets sucks if it doesn't do what you want.
* Realize that although we are glad to help you understand how to use
  wxWidgets, we won't write your program for you. You will get the best
  responses to your questions if you show evidence of having tried to solve the
  problem yourself, rather than asking for examples at every step.
