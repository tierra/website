As many of you might have heard, the Freenode IRC network changed management a
week ago, in what can only be described as a hostile takeover. The original
Freenode staff that has taken great care of us for about two decades now have
all resigned from Freenode, and created [Libera.Chat][libera], which we have
decided to migrate to. This decision aligns with hundreds other open source
projects making the same migration now, including [Ubuntu][1], [Gentoo][2],
[Wikimedia][3], [FreeBSD][4], [Fedora][5], [Arch Linux][6], [LibreELEC][7],
[Arduino][8], and [PostgreSQL][9]. We understand that this may be disruptive,
but believe this move will ultimately be best for everyone.

In order to ensure that our relatively small IRC community of users isn't
divided long term, we have muted our channel on Freenode, leaving a notice with
updated instructions for joining our new channel on Libera.Chat, where you will
find all of the same helpful and experienced wxWidgets users.

Please see our [IRC Channel][irc] page for help with connecting to Libera.Chat.
